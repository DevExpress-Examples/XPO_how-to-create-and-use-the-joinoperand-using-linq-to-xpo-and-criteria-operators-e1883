# How to create and use the JoinOperand using LINQ to XPO and Criteria Operators


<p>There are three approaches of creating the JoinOperand:</p><p>1. By using the constructor. The JoinOperand has three constructors. </p><p>The first constructor is parameterless. It can be used if necessary properties are assigned later. These properties are described below in the context of remainder constructors. </p><p>The second constructor takes two parameters. "joinTypeName" - the name of a persistent class that is used to join data. The class name can be specified with the namespace if there are classes with equal names. "condition" - the CriteriaOperator that is used to compare keys of the collections that are joined. In addition, there can be used any condition that isn't related to keys.</p><p>The third constructor has two additional parameters, allowing you to apply the aggregate expression to the result of the join operation. "type" - the type of the aggregateExpression. This parameter is of the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressDataFilteringAggregateEnumtopic"><u>Aggregate</u></a> type. "aggregatedExpression" - an expression that is used for calculating values.</p><p>2. By using the CriteriaOperator.Parse method. The general syntax for creating the JoinOperand is: <strong>[<JoinTypeName>][[^.ParentObjectProperty] = [JoinedObjectProperty]]</strong></p><p>3. By using the LINQ to XPO. The general syntax is the same as the syntax of the Join operation in LINQ:</p>

```cs
from e in employees<newline/>
join em in employees<newline/>
on e.Oid equals em.ManagerID<newline/>
into emg<newline/>
where emg.Count() > 10<newline/>
select e;<newline/>
From e In employees _ <newline/>
Group Join em In employees _ <newline/>
On e.Oid Equals em.ManagerID _ <newline/>
Into emg = Group _ <newline/>
Where emg.Count() > 10 _ <newline/>
Select e
```
